# the height of the bar has to be provided as a vector, a data frame does not suffice by itself

# calculate the means

# create a simple barplot
barplot(iris.mean$Sepal.Length)

# with some customisation

# "Beautiful, hassle-free plots:"
# the ggplot2 package implementing the Grammar of Graphics in R.

# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)


# from the abstract of the ggplot book:
# ggplot2 is an R package for producing statistical, or data, graphics, but it is unlike most other graphics packages because it has a deep underlying grammar. This grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson, 2005), is composed of a set of independent components that can be composed in many different ways. This makes ggplot2 very powerful, because you are not limited to a set of pre-specified graphics, but you can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your problem.

# Create a ggplot graph for each column

# Currently, the MultPlot function is hard-coded for the iris data frame.

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Question:
# How to modify the "MultPlot" function in a way that it accepts any data 
# frame (like "Loblolly"), not just "iris"?
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

# Expected result:
# After modifying the above function
# the following code should result in graphs for Loblolly
pdf("out.pdf")
        MultPlot(Loblolly)
dev.off()

# and this should result in graphs for iris
pdf("out.pdf")
        MultPlot(iris)
dev.off()

# Questions for session 5:
# How to separate elements out of one original element.
# I.e. deconcatenate


# PS:
# Some shortcomings in ggplot:
# most of them can be worked around outside of ggplot2
# 
# * No axis breaks allowed: H. Wickham, 2010, ggplot2 mailing list:
# "[..]  I'm not a big fan of this type of display because I think it is visually
# distorting.  I think it's much more appropriate to show two plots - one of all 
# the data, and one of just the small values. That way you can see how much the 
# large values dominate the smaller ones."

# * No secondary y-axis allowed: H. Wickham, 2010, Stackoverflow:
# "It's not possible in ggplot2 because plots with multiple y scales are fundamentally flawed." "And it will never be possible to add a secondary scale, just an secondary axes that is a transformation of the primary." H. Wickham, 2010 ggplot mailing list.

# * No inward facing tick marks: H. Wickham, 2009 ggplot2 mailing list:
# "I'm a pretty strong believer that tick marks should go outside the
# plot - otherwise it's very easy for them to overlap with data elements
# - and so there's no way to put them on the inside for ggplot2 (it also
# seems a little redundant given that there are already grid lines on
# the plot).  However, you can work around the lack by using geom_rug.
# Hadley Wickham, 2009 ggplot2 mailing list.
